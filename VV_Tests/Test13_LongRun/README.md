# Test 13: Long-Run Conservation & Periodicity

## Purpose
Check for secular drift over many cycles

## Setup
- Ellipsoid pitching (oscillatory kinematics)
- Run 20-50 cycles
- Monitor cycle-averaged quantities

## What to Measure
- Total scalar mass M(t)
- Peak C at sensor locations
- Force/kinematic periodicity

## Pass Criteria
- No artificial drift beyond source/sink effects
- Periodic metrics converge after ~5-10 cycles
- Mass conservation maintained long-term

## Implementation
Use production setup, long time integration
